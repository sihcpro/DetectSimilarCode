# DetectSimilarCode

This is a project that I want to help teacher and also student to recornize who is the copyer. I not only hope teacher can easy to find who is the copyer and have time for thier family but also student have to try hard to get more knowledge and ready for some more hard stupid things later. That 's all.

C++ is the target language that this project point to and I think that's enough for student who is newbie in my university. Everyone whose major is IT need to understand about C++ for their first step instead of copy friends's code.


* This code is base on Bash language to run an other programes.
* C++ is the language that I use to compine base code to what I want before compare them together.
* Python is the language that I use to compare all code because it have numpy that 'll very helpful for my fingerprint recognize algorithm.

      Run file detectSimilarCode.sh to start my programe.

# Thanks
